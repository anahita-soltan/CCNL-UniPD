# CCNL
The project I worked on during my internship in Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Lab of university of Padova.
It includes analysis of the number neurons in the CORnet model used in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39548-5#Sec38 article, using the same method as the one in the article and also some additional analysis.

The Data Source: https://zenodo.org/records/7976287

note: I have changed the name of "epoch1" in the pretrained model directory to "epoch49" to match the rest of the directories for ease of use. The pretrained data is in fact from the epoch1.

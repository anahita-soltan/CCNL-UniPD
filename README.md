# Neuron Activation Extraction

This branch contains scripts for extracting neuron activations from different layers and models for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Some results have been uploaded [here](https://unipdit-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/anahita_soltantouyeh_studenti_unipd_it/EpHyxJPaWJpJi4TE7m_jPcsB499oes0mMI6sq0zt8PPDvA?e=ySn9fE)

## Overview
The purpose of this task is to extract the activations of neurons from the pre-trained CORnet model and other models optimized using Adam and RMSProp. These activations will later be used for statistical comparisons and further analyses such as t-SNE or tuning curve evaluation.

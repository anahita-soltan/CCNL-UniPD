# Nasr & Neider (2019) Method Application

This branch implements the method described in Nasr & Neider (2019) to remove summation units (monotonic neurons) from the dataset and recalculates tuning curves after this refinement.

## Overview
The Nasr & Neider (2019) method is applied to remove monotonic neurons (summation units) from the dataset, refining the analysis and providing more precise tuning curve calculations.

## Directory Structure
- **`nasr_method.py`**: Script implementing the Nasr & Neider (2019) method to clean the dataset.
- **`recalculated_tuning_curves/`**: Directory containing recalculated tuning curves after applying the Nasr & Neider method.

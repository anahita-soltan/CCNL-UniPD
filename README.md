# Tuning Curve Analysis

This branch focuses on calculating and visualizing tuning curves for pooled and normalized neurons with the same preferred number, as detected and archived through the ANOVA analysis.

## Overview
Tuning curves represent the response properties of neurons under different conditions. This analysis aims to calculate and visualize these curves for neurons pooled and normalized based on their preferred number, offering insight into their behavior under various experimental conditions.
